# Daily News Display
Displays daily news and allows user to create, update and delete the news from the admin panel in Django. Also each news can be seperately clicked to open individual news link without needing to create a seperate page for it. Each seperate link creates an auto slug for the news for better readibility and SEO. Also works better for security purposes.
